#### Steps to find out Anomaly Detection in Elastic machine learing

##### step 1 : Sign up for an Elastic Cloud account

If you don't already have an Elastic Cloud account, sign up for one on the Elastic Cloud website.


##### step 2 : Create an Elasticsearch cluster

In the Elastic Cloud console, create an Elasticsearch cluster. You can choose the size, location, and other parameters of your cluster based on your needs and budget


##### step 3 : Enable machine learning

Once your Elasticsearch cluster is created, you can enable machine learning by going to the Kibana tab in the Elastic Cloud console and clicking on the "Machine Learning" button


##### step 4 : Ingest sample data

Elastic Cloud provides sample data sets that you can use to test and demonstrate the capabilities of Elastic machine learning. In Kibana, go to the "Machine Learning" tab, click on "Data Visualizer", and select "Sample data" to ingest a sample data set.


##### step 5 : Create an anomaly detection job

 In Kibana, create an anomaly detection job using the sample data set by specifying the data source, selecting the machine learning algorithm, and setting the analysis parameters



##### step 6 : Train the model

Once the anomaly detection job is configured, train the machine learning model on the sample data set.


##### step 7 : Review the results

After the model is trained, review the results in Kibana. The anomaly detection job will flag any data points that are considered anomalous based on the model's analysis.


##### step 8 : Take action

Finally, take action on the anomalous data points, such as investigating the root cause of the anomaly, alerting stakeholders, or triggering automated responses.
